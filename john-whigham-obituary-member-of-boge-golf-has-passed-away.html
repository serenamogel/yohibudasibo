Whigham. He fought a courageous battle against ALS, inspiring everyone who had the privilege of knowing him. As we mourn his loss, we also celebrate the incredible life he led and the indelible mark he left on the world of golf and those affected by ALS. For those who had the privilege of knowing John, his love for golf was evident from an early age. He instilled in us not just the skills of the game but the values and camaraderie that make golf so special. Golf was more than just a pastime for him; it was a lifelong passion that he eagerly shared with his family and friends.</p><p>One of the things we will always cherish is his impressive short game. His precision around the green was nothing short of extraordinary, and his dedication to perfecting this aspect of his game inspired us to improve our own skills. We often found ourselves in awe of his ability to effortlessly navigate challenging situations and make incredible shots. But John was not only a master of the game; he was a fierce competitor. He brought an unparalleled level of intensity to every round, pushing us to strive for excellence. The joy he found in competition, whether he won or lost, was infectious and a testament to his unwavering love for the sport.</p><p>John’s impact extended far beyond the fairways and greens. He was a man who believed in giving back, even in the face of adversity. Despite his own battle with ALS, he chose to be a beacon of hope for others. John became an integral part of the “Keep Swinging Campaign,” using his situation to raise awareness and support for those affected by this devastating disease. His heroic efforts in this campaign touched the lives of many, offering hope, inspiration, and much-needed resources to those battling ALS. One of the lasting legacies of John C. Whigham is “The John C. Whigham Collection.” This collection is a testament to his dedication to the game of golf and his commitment to helping others. It is a living tribute to a man who saw the bigger picture, who understood the power of unity, and who believed in leaving the world a better place.</p><p>As we move forward, Lucas and I are committed to preserving our father’s memory and carrying on his mission. We will continue to support projects that aid those who are dealing with ALS, ensuring that the fight against this cruel disease remains strong. In conclusion, John C. Whigham was more than a golfer; he was a man of exceptional character, unwavering resilience, and boundless generosity. His legacy lives on not only in our hearts but also in the countless lives he touched. We are profoundly grateful for the time we had with him and the lessons he taught us both on and off the golf course. So, until our next round, we carry his spirit with us, honoring his memory and ensuring that his passion for golf and his dedication to making a difference continue to thrive. John C. Whigham, you may have left us, but your legacy will forever inspire us to “Keep Swinging.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZbDprrLsmSmnZ2kv6qty6xlnKedZLewtM1mrqGhl52urnnOm6CtrZGnxm65xKaZnqpdpLNurs6gnGafn6GzbrTArGSpmaOosqV5wLCYsmc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjohn-whigham-obituary-member-of-boge-golf-has-passed-away.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjohn-whigham-obituary-member-of-boge-golf-has-passed-away.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjohn-whigham-obituary-member-of-boge-golf-has-passed-away.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjohn-whigham-obituary-member-of-boge-golf-has-passed-away.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjohn-whigham-obituary-member-of-boge-golf-has-passed-away.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-whigham-obituary-member-of-boge-golf-has-passed-away.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./diem-lien-net-worth-2021-age-wikipedia-biography-height-family.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./diem-lien-net-worth-2021-age-wikipedia-biography-height-family.html>Diem Lien Net Worth, Age, Wikipedia, Biography, Height, Family</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./isaiah-thomas-net-worth-2024.html>Isaiah Thomas Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./isaiah-thomas-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
