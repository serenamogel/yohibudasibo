<time>26 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Jordan Ross Belfort, born on July 9, 1962, gained notoriety through the portrayal of his life by Leonardo DiCaprio in the film “The Wolf of Wall Street.” Originally from Queens, New York, Jordan worked as a stockbroker at an investment firm. This was before establishing his own trading company, Stratton Oakmont.</p><p>However, his involvement in fraudulent activities and money laundering led to legal consequences and his wife divorcing him. In 1999, Jordan pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering charges, resulting in a prison sentence of four years. He served approximately twenty-two months before his release.</p><p>His memoir, with the same title as the film, “The Wolf of Wall Street,” was the basis for the Martin Scorsese-directed movie. Jordan was married twice with two children, including Chandler Belfort. Here’s what we know about her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Capture-fotor-20230708114520.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Chandler_Belfort_Bio></span>Chandler Belfort Bio<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jordan Belfort and Nadine Caridi had their first child, Chandler, on July 29, 1993. They later had another child, Carter. Despite their subsequent split, Jordan maintained a strong bond with his children. He frequently shares pictures of them on social media, emphasizing the importance of family.</p><p>Chandler has a limited social media presence. She does not have a Twitter account, and her Instagram page is private, indicating her preference for maintaining privacy. Chandler has a career in psychology and is licensed as a psychologist in New York.</p><p>She attended Vistamar School from 2008 to 2012. Afterward, she enrolled at Muhlenberg College, obtaining a bachelor’s degree in Psychology and Spanish Language, Literature, and Culture in 2016. Chandler furthered her studies at New York University’s Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>Chandler completed her master’s degree in mental health counseling. She gained experience as a mental health counseling intern at Berkeley College for ten months. Subsequently, she worked as a mental health professional at a private practice for over two years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Capture-fotor-20230708115320.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Chandler_Belfort_Married></span>Is Chandler Belfort Married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2021, Chandler Belfort married Connor Winter, who attended Muhlenberg College. Winter pursued Business Marketing and Finance studies, played varsity football and lacrosse, and was involved in the Investment Society.</p><p>Winter gained experience in project coordination and worked as a video producer. He held positions such as Client Services Coordinator at LuMee LLC in 2015 before transitioning to project coordination and management roles at The Muse.</p><p>As revealed in an Instagram post, Connor Winter proposed to Chandler in December 2019. Winter expressed his joy in being engaged to Chandler, emphasizing that they had known each other for over seven years and had been in a relationship for nearly that long.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/d30dadd7684187c1cd015118e3631b9e.jpg><p>Chandler and Winter tied the knot in September 2021. Winter shared a heartfelt video on his <a href=#>Instagram</a>, dedicated to Chandler, featuring memorable moments from their relationship, including the day of his proposal. He mentioned that they had serendipitously met at Muhlenberg College.</p><p>Jordan Belfort proudly shared a photo of Chandler on her wedding day, showcasing her transformation from a teenager with braces to a grown woman wearing a wedding dress and holding a bouquet. The affectionate image captured the loving gaze between father and daughter.</p><p>Chandler and Winter enjoy spending quality time together, evident from his Instagram posts. He shares pictures from their adventures in different countries.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Did_Chandler_Belforts_Mother_Say_About_the_%E2%80%9CWolf_of_Wall_Street%E2%80%9D></span>What Did Chandler Belfort’s Mother Say About the “Wolf of Wall Street?”<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After remarrying, Nadine Caridi changed her last name to Macaluso. She pursued a career as a licensed marriage and family therapist. Years after her portrayal by Margot Robbie in “The Wolf of Wall Street,” she used her professional expertise to speak out about her toxic marriage to Jordan Belfort.</p><p>Nadine revealed that while the film accurately portrayed certain aspects of their relationship, it primarily showcased Jordan’s perspective rather than her own. In a TikTok video, she discussed how Jordan employed tactics like “love bombing” to manipulate and win her affection.</p><p>Love bombing involves overwhelming someone with excessive attention and respect to gain control, and it is considered a part of the cycle of abuse. Nadine acknowledged falling in love with Jordan due to his love-bombing behavior.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/daaf77dc381c37340d35639c46b4deb8.jpg><p>However, she confirmed the accuracy of specific scenes in the movie. The scene where flowers surround Margot Robbie’s character was based on an actual incident, where Jordan filled their small apartment with an excessive amount of flowers, expanding it to over a thousand square feet from its original eight hundred square feet, and the yacht scene, where Leonardo DiCaprio’s character tells Robbie’s character that they would sail to Monaco for a work-related matter.&nbsp;</p><p>Chandler Belfort has never publicly commented on her parents’ marriage. She remains focused on her professional growth as a psychologist and building a fulfilling personal life. John Travolta’s daughter <a href=#>Ella Bleu </a>is another young lady who pushed herself to fulfill her dreams outside of her father’s fame.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ksKmtzZ2jnqpdl7Ktss6rq2armJp6p7vUp5tmoJWnerGt06FknZ2jpba1sYyhnKtllpbBqbHRrGSpmaOpfA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchandler-belfort-she-found-her-path-despite-her-fathers-past.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchandler-belfort-she-found-her-path-despite-her-fathers-past.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchandler-belfort-she-found-her-path-despite-her-fathers-past.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchandler-belfort-she-found-her-path-despite-her-fathers-past.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchandler-belfort-she-found-her-path-despite-her-fathers-past.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchandler-belfort-she-found-her-path-despite-her-fathers-past.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./trek-buccino-net-worth-325387.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./trek-buccino-net-worth-325387.html>Trek Buccino Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./best-asian-snacks-at-world-market.html>Asian Snacks You Should Be Buying at World Market</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./best-asian-snacks-at-world-market.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
