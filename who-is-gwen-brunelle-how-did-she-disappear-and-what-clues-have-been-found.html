In June, 2023, <strong>Gwen Brunelle</strong> of Boise, Idaho disappeared on a sudden roadtrip to California, and a series of clues so far discovered have only deepened the mystery.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=429 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true>Reportedly, 27-year-old Brunelle left Boise on Monday, June 26 with her 11 show rabbits in tow. Brunelle was a passionate trainer of rabbits from the time she was a child. She told her boyfriend and family she was on her way to Fresno, California to meet with a renowned rabbit judge, but she never made it. When spoken to later, the unnamed California rabbit judge said he never heard from her, nor was he expecting her arrival.</p><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>By Friday that week, Brunelle’s car was found abandoned on a remote stretch of road in Southeastern Oregon, with no trace of the Idaho woman to be seen, according to the Oregon news outlet <a href=#>Malheur Enterprise</a>. What searchers did find, though, were Brunelle’s rabbits still in the car, and alongside her vehicle, a half-empty jug of water and a bathrobe, folded on the ground like someone had made a cushion or pillow out of it.</p><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false>Furthermore, the keys were in the ignition, the windows were rolled down, and Brunelle’s personal items — including her credit cards and her driver’s license — were undisturbed.</p><h2 id=h-brunelle-was-last-seen-at-a-nearby-gas-station-and-store data-injectable=false>Brunelle was last seen at a nearby gas station and store</h2><figure class=wp-block-video data-current-count=193 data-injectable=false>Video via Brunelle family/Findgwen.com</figure><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>On Tuesday the week Gwen Brunelle’s car was found, a nearby gas station attendant said he saw Brunelle as she stopped for gas, and for some reason she told him she was in a hurry, <a href=#>OregonLive</a> reported.</p><p data-characters=549 data-current-count=549 data-injectable=true>And this was not the only strange circumstance surrounding her disappearance. Reportedly, a short distance from her home in Idaho, Brunelle’s phone was turned off, and additional convenience store security camera footage from her trip revealed she changed her clothing just 20 miles away from Boise. Not only that, it seemed to take her three hours to travel those miles, and where she was during that time is so far unexplained. Meanwhile, her father, Andy Brunelle, said he lost cell phone contact with his daughter the same day that she left.</p><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true>After buying gas in Southeastern Oregon, Brunelle reportedly entered another store near the gas station and asked for a razor blade, which they didn’t have. She then bought water and snacks and returned to her car, where she sat for an hour, one witness reported — so long, in fact, a clerk asked her is she was all right. A clerk later told the Malheur County Sheriff’s office, “She said she was fine and did not need any help.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The initial search turned up nothing</h2><p data-characters=689 data-current-count=689 data-injectable=true>Once Gwen Brunelle’s car was found, authorities scoured the rugged area by land and air, but there was no sign of her and the search, using ATVs, horses, and dogs, was suspended. By early September, however, signs of Brunelle emerged, and searchers redoubled their effort. First, Brunelle’s t-shirt was found caught in barbed wire fencing, and later, her boots and socks were spotted nearby. The boots in particular seemed to have been arranged on the ground intentionally. Despite those encouraging signs, however, Brunelle’s whereabouts remain a mystery. Deepening the concern, the Southeastern Oregon rangeland is an inhospitable place for anyone to survive for long.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>With Brunelle gone, theories as to what might have happened to her involve a possible abduction, or a fake story about traveling to see the rabbit judge but meeting up with someone else, instead. Reportedly, there were inconsistencies between what she told her boyfriend and her father about her purported trip to California.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Brunelle may have had a mental health crisis</h2><p data-characters=552 data-current-count=877 data-injectable=true>Another possible explanation, Brunelle was known to have mental health challenges, her mother, Betsy Brunelle, said, and a failure to take her medication could possibly explain her behavior. The ominous request for a razor blade at a nearby convenience store could relate to how she cut her pills in half, her mother added. For the time being, the multi-state search for Brunelle continues. Brunelle is 5’7″ tall and weighs 160 pounds, and may present disoriented or be in the midst of a mental health crisis, according to the authorities.</p><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>Though hope remained that Brunelle might be found alive, her mother told OregonLive, “I just have not sensed a presence of her on this earth. It’s just like a mom thing. If she is alive, that would be fantastic. If she’s not, hopefully we can bring her back and have closure.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX6y1sHnIrGSgr5WjeqO%2B1KecpaSVYrWww4ydoJ1lo52ybrDIrJipqJWWv26tzZ1ksKCRqXqkuNSeqmagkauybq7EnqVmnp%2Bqu6V7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-gwen-brunelle-how-did-she-disappear-and-what-clues-have-been-found.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-gwen-brunelle-how-did-she-disappear-and-what-clues-have-been-found.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-gwen-brunelle-how-did-she-disappear-and-what-clues-have-been-found.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-gwen-brunelle-how-did-she-disappear-and-what-clues-have-been-found.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-gwen-brunelle-how-did-she-disappear-and-what-clues-have-been-found.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-gwen-brunelle-how-did-she-disappear-and-what-clues-have-been-found.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./leslie-hamilton-gearren.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./leslie-hamilton-gearren.html>Leslie Hamilton Gearren- Meet Identical Sister Of Linda Hamilton</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./acure-ultra-hydrating-shampoo-review-7187375.html>I Use This $9 Shampoo to Hyrdate My Dry and Frizzy Color-Treated Hair</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./acure-ultra-hydrating-shampoo-review-7187375.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
