The actor has numerous film credits with both Helena and Tim.</p><p>It’s interesting to note that while Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was being filmed, Johnny and director Tim were speaking. But the actor was not allowed to be asked to godfather his son by the director. Thus, on behalf of her spouse, Johhny was called a few minutes later by the mother of Tim’s newborn boy, Carter.</p><h2><span id=Prince_William_declined_to_be_the_godfather_of_Nell>Prince William declined to be the godfather of Nell</span></h2><p>According to Bonham Carter, when she was drunk, she once asked Prince William to be the godfather of her kid, but he declined.</p><p>In November 2019, Carter stated, “I wasn’t that drunk, but enough drunk for me to not drink anymore,” when making an appearance on Bravo’s “Watch What Happens Live.” Burton’s mother disclosed that the prince gave her a happy response.</p><p>The king reportedly said to the actress-mother, “You don’t want me to be godfather to your child.” She also disclosed that they had met before to the Duke’s union with Kate. At one occasion, while Bonham Carter was visiting Mustique, he became extremely inebriated. Helena recalls that the prince “quite wisely said no” when she asked him to be his daughter’s godfather. Onell’s mother claims that she gave her son eleven godparents who were all in the film business when he was born. She said that there were none regarding her daughter. Thus, in her opinion, Prince William was a wise option.</p><h2><span id=When_Nell8217s_actress_mother_is_relieved_that_she_isn8217t_always_required_to_see_her_children>When Nell’s actress mother is relieved that she isn’t always required to see her children,</span></h2><p>In an October 2020 interview with the Guardian, Nell’s mother talked about how she, Burton, and their children were handling their split.</p><p>The actress disclosed that all of their kids, including Nell, were doing well.
