It was ancient, and had existed since medieval times. It could prevent a Legilimens from accessing one’s thoughts and feelings, or influencing them. A wizard or witch who practised this art was known as an Occlumens.</strong></p><p>Is Draco Malfoy a Legilimens? Draco the Occlumens</p><p>There was, however, one Hogwarts student who <b>mastered</b> Occlumency: Draco Malfoy. … Draco mastered Occlumency with help from his aunt Bellatrix.</p><p>Simply so, Who is a Legilimens in Harry Potter? Legilimency was the act of magically navigating through the many layers of a person’s mind and correctly interpreting one’s findings. <b>A person who practised this art</b> was known as a Legilimens.</p><p>Why did Snape not teach Harry Occlumency? The lessons were ultimately cancelled when Harry saw a memory in the Pensieve of his <b>father hanging Snape in the air</b> by his ankles and was caught by the Potions Master, while Snape postponed the lessons in order to rescue Graham Montague from being stuck inside a toilet.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_do_you_become_a_Legilimens></span>How do you become a Legilimens?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Those learning Legilimency began with a spell and an <b>incantation – Legilimens</b>. Snape demonstrated this to Harry during their first Occlumency lesson, in a bid to teach him the skills needed to shut his mind to Voldemort’s Legilimency attacks.</p><p>Also What if Harry learned Occlumency? If Harry mastered Occlumency, <b>he would likely be harder to manipulate</b>. However, the connection between Harry and Voldemort resulted from the piece of Voldemort’s soul in Harry. Occulmency is the art of shielding the mind from outside penetration, not exactly internal penetration.</p><p>Are Legilimens born? Yes, of <b>someone is born as a Legilimens</b>, he/she has the ability to read other’s minds from a very young age. This ability becomes second nature to them, just like us if we look at someone to see how they feel and how we are supposed to act around them.</p><p>Is Legilimency real? Legilimency is <b>an advanced form of wizardry</b>, the supernatural ability to coax thoughts and feelings and memories from another’s mind. It’s a magical skill encompassing mind reading and lie detection–and it’s black magic in the wrong hands. … Humans are actually very bad at everyday mind reading.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Dumbledore_a_Legilimens></span>Is Dumbledore a Legilimens?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As we are told in wizarding world lore, <b>Dumbledore is a Legilimens</b>, which means that he can read minds (as a side note, although Queenie has the same skill, her skill is much more powerful as it can delve deeper into a person).</p><p>Is Narcissa a Legilimens? Occlumency (possibly): Though it <b>was never confirmed</b>, it was still implied that Narcissa was probably a skilful Occlumens, due to her ability to effectively lie to Voldemort himself, who was believed to be the most accomplished Legilimens of his time.</p><p>How does Harry read snapes mind?</p><p>He didn’t. <b>Snape used the Legilimens</b> (mind-reading) spell on Harry, and Harry used the Protego Charm, sending it rebounding on Snape. Basically, Harry caused Snape’s mind-reading spell to boomerang onto him so harry was able to use the spell and not Snape.</p><p>Is Luna a Legilimens? Originally Answered: Was Luna Lovegood a legilimen? If she was, <b>there was never any visible evidence of it</b>. She was observant and intelligent, and very insightful at times. None of that requires legilimency, so there’s not much in the way of hard evidence for or against her having the ability.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Legilimency_taught></span>Is Legilimency taught?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b>Legilimency isn’t taught at Hogwarts</b> because to do so would be unethical. Despite the fancy latin name, it’s mind reading. It’s the ability to look inside someone else’s head and see their most private thoughts, their deepest darkest secrets.</p><p>How do I get out of Legilimens?</p><p></p><p>What is Levicorpus spell? <b>The Dangling Jinx</b> (Levicorpus) was a jinx, which was intended to be cast nonverbally but the incantation could also be spoken aloud, caused the victim to be hoisted into the air by their ankle; the counter-jinx for this jinx was Liberacorpus.</p><p>Where is Legilimens in RO wizard? Legilimens is located in <b>the restricted section of the library</b>. To access it, you need the headmaster’s key, obtained by catching the snitch.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Are_you_born_a_Legilimens></span>Are you born a Legilimens?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b>Yes</b>, of someone is born as a Legilimens, he/she has the ability to read other’s minds from a very young age. This ability becomes second nature to them, just like us if we look at someone to see how they feel and how we are supposed to act around them.</p><p>Did Narcissa and Andromeda reconcile? No. Narcissa and Andomeda were once close I believe but <b>Narcissa never changed her ways</b>. She believed in keeping the line pure. Andromeda’s family was killed in the war but Narcissa’s family lived.</p><p>Are Narcissa and Sirius related?</p><p>Her sister Narcissa (another of <b>Sirius’ first cousins</b>) married Lucius Malfoy, himself a renowned Dark wizard instrumental to Voldemort’s rise. … For example, Bellatrix and Narcissa, in addition to being Sirius’ first cousins, are also his third cousins on his mother’s side.</p><p>What spell does Ginny use in Order of the Phoenix? In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, only Ginny casts <b>the Reductor Curse</b> to smash the shelves in the Hall of Prophecy, instead of every D.A. member present.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_did_Harry_learn_from_Trelawney></span>What did Harry learn from Trelawney?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>When Dumbledore asks Harry what is wrong, Harry tells him what he has just learned about <b>Snape</b> from Trelawney. … He tells Harry that, yes, Snape worked for Voldemort at the time, but he had soon after left the Dark Lord.
