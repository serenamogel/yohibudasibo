Lincoln decided to grow out his whiskers in part thanks to some well-meaning advice from a young supporter. The beard won public approval and may have helped keep Lincoln safe from an assassination plot in 1861.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Contemporaries often mocked Lincoln's appearance</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lincoln was striking to behold: he had a gaunt, wrinkled face, a long neck and was tall enough to tower over his contemporaries. And throughout his career, mocking his appearance was considered fair game. When he was running for president in 1860 a paper in Houston <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/11/great-emancipator-or-creepy-slob-historic-portrayals-of-abraham-lincoln/264988/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="described him" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">described him</a> as "the leanest, lankiest, most ungainly mass of legs, arms, and hatchet face ever strung upon a single frame." The Charleston Mercury <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://books.google.ca/books?id=L7ZDo_sjOFMC&pg=PA247#v=onepage&q&f=false" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="deemed him" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">deemed him</a> a "horrid-looking wretch."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Photographs were becoming more widely available, but the current methods called for lengthy posing times that made it impossible to capture Lincoln's smile and approachability. Photos could be and were retouched, but some Republicans in New York <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://books.google.ca/books?id=L7ZDo_sjOFMC&pg=PA247#v=onepage&q&f=false" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=believed class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">believed</a> Lincoln "would be much improved in appearance, provided you would cultivate whiskers, and wear standing collars." An 11-year-old Lincoln supporter in New York named Grace Bedell agreed with this assessment.</p><img alt="Abraham Lincoln" title="Abraham Lincoln" width=3238 height=3981 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/lincoln_dp274831.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Photo: Metropolitan Museum of Art; Gilman Collection, Purchase, Joyce F.

Following this, and after listening to some classmates disparage the candidate, on October 15 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://time.com/3462545/abraham-lincoln-beard/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bedell wrote Lincoln a letter" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Bedell wrote Lincoln a letter</a> that said in part: "I have yet got four brothers and part of them will vote for you any way and if you let your whiskers grow I will try and get the rest of them to vote for you you would look a great deal better for your face is so thin. All the ladies like whiskers and they would tease their husbands to vote for you and then you would be President."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In his response to Bedell on October 19, Lincoln <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40187731?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3A3ab4e742578ad2ad74a727a892694505&seq=1" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="shared some concerns" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">shared some concerns</a> regarding her advice: "As to the whiskers, having never worn any, do you not think people would call it a piece of silly affection if I were to begin wearing them now?" It seemed Lincoln didn't plan to follow the girl's suggestion. After all, he wasn't vain and in fact had a history of engaging in self-deprecating humor about his looks. When opponent Stephen Douglas <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/lincoln-a-beard-is-born/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="called him" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">called him</a> "two-faced" during a debate in 1858, Lincoln is said to have answered, "If I had another face, do you think I’d wear this one?"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lincoln went on to win the presidency, but soon after the election, he told his barber he wanted to let his whiskers grow. It's uncertain exactly why he made the decision. Lincoln may have felt a beard could help set him apart from clean-shaven presidential predecessors like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/james-buchanan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="James Buchanan" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">James Buchanan</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/franklin-pierce data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Franklin Pierce" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Franklin Pierce</a>, whose missteps had led the nation to the brink of war. The facial hair may have been intended to provide a link to his frontier background as he headed to Washington, D.C., or perhaps he'd decided to spruce up his image before holding the highest office in the land. Whatever the reason for his decision, it made Lincoln the country's first fully-bearded president.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Many people liked Lincoln's beard</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lincoln stopped in Westfield, New York, on the way to his inauguration to show his new beard to Bedell. The girl was shy and overwhelmed by the experience, but presumably approved of the addition. There were other constituents who also applauded Lincoln's new facial hair. One report <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://books.google.com/books?id=nmibKY8iY84C&pg=PA18#v=onepage&q&f=false" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=stated class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">stated</a>, "A vigorous growth of comely whiskers has entirely changed his facial appearance." A woman in his hometown of Springfield felt that his "whiskers are a great improvement."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fortunately, such approbation didn't inflate Lincoln's ego. A few weeks before becoming president, he <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://books.google.ca/books?id=acxcOfge46kC&pg=PA44#v=onepage&q&f=false" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=declared class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">declared</a> to one crowd: "I have stepped out upon this platform that I may see you and that you may see me, and in the arrangement I have the best of the bargain." And of course, not everyone was won over. One paper, despite being pro-Lincoln, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://books.google.com/books?id=fn0wBAAAQBAJ" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=decided class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">decided</a> that even with a beard the president-elect was still "very homely."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, one man almost certainly loathed Lincoln's whiskers, at least at first. In 1860, Milton Bradley had produced a lithograph of a beardless Lincoln. But Lincoln's new facial hair rendered Bradley's inventory out-of-date and useless. Following this business disaster, Bradley began selling a board game called the Checkered Game of Life. It became the first in a long line of successes. Without Lincoln's beard, Bradley's new career might not have happened.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Lincoln's new beard may have helped save his life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On his way to Washington, D.C., for his inauguration on March 4, 1861, Lincoln learned that a group of secessionists in Baltimore were plotting his assassination. There was then no Secret Service to provide protection, so Lincoln and his supporters were on their own. Lincoln decided to follow the advice of Allan Pinkerton, of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, and alter his publicly known itinerary in order to travel through Baltimore earlier than expected, before any would-be killers would know of his arrival.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The new plans required Lincoln to remain incognito while riding in public rail cars and switching between train stations. There was just one bodyguard with him, so if the president-elect were to be spotted he would have little defense against unfriendly crowds. To keep from being recognized, Lincoln chose a hat in a different style than what he usually wore and hunched over to alter his notable height. His new beard may also have served to shield his identity — though Lincoln had been seen in public with facial hair, he'd been clean-shaven until November of the previous year. Many people still didn't expect to see a bearded Lincoln.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lincoln safely made it to the capital on February 23. After word of his secret railway dash became public, he was widely mocked in the press (with some spreading false rumors that the president-elect had disguised himself as a woman). Lincoln came to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/intelligence-history/civil-war/Intel_in_the_CW1.pdf data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=regret class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">regret</a> traveling "like a thief in the night," but at least he was alive, perhaps in part thanks to his new beard.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGinqKSZqbakrctmnaKfpaeytHvAm6maoJGieq21zZympaZdl7KivsM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fabraham-lincoln-beard.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fabraham-lincoln-beard.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fabraham-lincoln-beard.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fabraham-lincoln-beard.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fabraham-lincoln-beard.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fabraham-lincoln-beard.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./thelma-ritter-net-worth-188276.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./thelma-ritter-net-worth-188276.html>Thelma Ritter Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./eugenia-jones-net-worth.html>Eugenia Jones Net Worth Phone Number, House Address, Wiki</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./eugenia-jones-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
