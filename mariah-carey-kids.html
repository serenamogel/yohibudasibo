I wouldn’t be the same person without them,” Carey&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told People</a> in 2019.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4>“I think Nick and I have done pretty well in co-parenting, staying friends with each other so that we can talk,” she continued.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">The pair have made a slew of public appearances, including at the 2023 Billboard Music Awards. <span class=credit>Penske Media via Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6>“I want my kids to understand that every child isn’t as fortunate as they are. … It’s hard, but I try to keep them grounded so they don’t think everything is just handed to them.”</p><p>Through the years, Moroccan and Monroe have dipped in and out of the spotlight, <a href=#>appearing with their mom at the&nbsp;2022 Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade</a> and even <a href=#>presenting her with a special Billboard Music Award</a>&nbsp;the following year.</p><p>Read on for everything you need to know about the twins.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Monroe Cannon</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">Monroe is the singer’s mini-me. <span class=credit>Instagram/mariahcarey</span></figure><p>Carey’s daughter, Monroe, was her firstborn.</p><p>The “Obsessed” singer wrote in her 2020 memoir,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>“The Meaning of Mariah Carey,”</a> that she wanted both of her kids to share her initials.</p><p>She noted that her daughter’s moniker was inspired by&nbsp;Marilyn Monroe; however, Carey refers to her as Roe. (Unlike Moroccan, Monroe doesn’t have a middle name.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28>Much like her mom, the youngster proved she has a set of pipes when she performed “Always Be My Baby” onstage in Los Angeles in 2017.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">She has appeared onstage with her mom on several occasions. <span class=credit>Getty Images for MC</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30>“Miss Monroe has a really, really good ear for music and a really beautiful tone, but I can’t force her to sing, so if she wants to sing, she’ll sing,” Carey said in 2016.</p><p>And the pop diva’s mini-me is a multihyphenate talent, as she <a href=#>made her modeling debut</a> in a 2021 OshKosh B’Gosh commercial, in which she played a younger version of her mom.</p><p>“As a little girl, I was determined to realize my dreams,” Carey said in a voice-over.</p><p>“Now as a mother, it brings me so much joy to see my children visualize and develop the dreams they hold in their own hearts.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">Monroe has also been in social media videos with both of her parents, who have attested to her sweet nature. <span class=credit>FilmMagic</span></figure><p>As she entered her preteen years, Monroe continued to display her passion for music when she&nbsp;joined Carey onstage in Toronto in 2022&nbsp;for a performance of “Away in a Manger.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33>She and her brother have also made a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">slew of hilarious videos</a> with their parents, revealing they may have inherited some of their dad’s humor.</p><p>In a 2023 interview on the&nbsp;“Howie Mandel Does Stuff”&nbsp;podcast, Cannon described the twins as “so intelligent” and “in tune with their own values.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13>“It’s my first time having 12-year-olds, and I have a set of them! And&nbsp;we’re having real conversations,” he explained.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13>“Because, you know, their lives are far from normal.

I want to show my mom so bad,” the then-5-year-old sweetly said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">Much like his sister, he has appeared onstage with Carey through the years. <span class=credit>Getty Images for MC</span></figure><p>He also featured in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a video from New Year’s Eve 2020</a>, in which he gave a hilarious speech.</p><p>“A lot of people might’ve not thought that this year was perfect, but this year was inspiring to me … ’cause I had it too good for too long, man,” Moroccan said. “And I just was like ‘Ah, this is so good,’ and I needed a jumpstart.”</p><p>Moroccan’s dad revealed his mini-me has a funny side — and even once called him a “player” in reference to <a href=#>his ever-growing brood of children</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60>“It’s the funniest thing, my kids call me a player. I was like, ‘Who taught you that word? Who’s been talking to you?'” Cannon&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told “Entertainment Tonight”</a> in 2020. “And [Moroccan’s] like, ‘Dad, you can’t be a player forever.’ I’m like, this is the worst.”</p><p>Moroccan’s sense of humor was even corroborated by Kim Kardashian, who called him “the funniest kid” in a 2023 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram post</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZyytLXXZ5qopV%2BlrrOxza2qaKWRp7aitIycmKudqWK4qrDSaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmariah-carey-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmariah-carey-kids.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmariah-carey-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmariah-carey-kids.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmariah-carey-kids.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmariah-carey-kids.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./poliwag-tcg.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./poliwag-tcg.html>Poliwag (TCG) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./william-daniels-missing-update-2023-is-he-found-yet.html>Cleveland William Daniels Missing Update 2023: Is He Found Yet?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./william-daniels-missing-update-2023-is-he-found-yet.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
