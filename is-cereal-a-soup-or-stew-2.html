It may be smooth in texture, and there are also recipes that include chunks of tomato, cream, chicken or vegetable stock, vermicelli, chunks of other vegetables and meatballs.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-tea-a-soup></span>Is tea a soup?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Of course <b>tea isn’t soup</b>, or liquor, it’s just an infusion, a preparation of some brewed dry substance in hot water. It could accurately be called a tisane, which had been used as a term for that, for any brewed material.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-chili-a-soup></span>Is chili a soup?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Is chili different from soup and stew?

In fact, in so many countries, it was a word popularized by colonizers to simplify what they saw as foreign cuisines.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-gumbo-a-stew></span>Is Gumbo a stew?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>gumbo, an <b>aromatic soup-stew</b> characteristic of the Creole cuisine of Louisiana, combining African, American Indian, and European elements.

That’s why it’s traditionally braised in stock and turned into beef stew.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-curry-called-in-india></span>What is curry called in India?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>There is no such thing as a “curry”</b> in India<p>The word curry is simply used to describe the gravy or sauce in a dish in India.
