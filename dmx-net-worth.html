His album entitled “And Then There Was X” was released in 1999 and soon became one of the best-selling albums recorded by DMX.</p><p>How rich is DMX then? As of mid-2017, according to authoritative sources, DMX’s net worth is estimated to be negative, as much as minus -$10 million – even though DMX is considered to be one of the best-selling rap artists, his wealth has been cut down by his debts.</p><h3>DMX Net Worth -$10 Million</h3><p>Having undergone an abusive and unhealthy childhood, DMX focused on his career in 1988 when he started working as a beatboxer. DMX’s fame spread locally, and a year later he was offered a deal with Ruffhouse, a subsidiary record label of Columbia Records, and it was with Ruffhouse that DMX recorded and released his first single entitled “Born Loser”. Even though the song did not do well on the market, it was DMX’s first step to becoming a successful rap artist. However, before DMX really launched into his solo career, he contributed to various tracks of such artists as <a href=#>Jay-Z</a>, <a href=#>LL Cool J</a>, <a href=#>Mase</a> and <a href=#>Ja Rule</a>. In 1988, DMX debuted with a single “Get at Me Dog” that achieved gold certification from RIAA, and that same year released his debut album called “It’s Dark and Hell is Hot” – considered to be a classic rap album, it produced four singles and introduced DMX to the music industry. DMX’s subsequent album – “Year of the Dog… Again” – sold over 350,000 copies and so earned him $350,000 in 2011.</p><p>With the success of his albums, DMX’s fame rose steadily, which also contributed significantly to his net worth. That same year, DMX released his third album – “Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood” – which peaked at #1 on Billboard charts and sold over 670,000 copies during its first week.</p><p>DMX has released a total of seven albums so far, but music is not the only career path he has taken. In 1998, he debuted in the role of Tommy Bundy in <a href=#>Hype Williams</a>’ movie “Belly”, in which he co-starred with <a href=#>Nas</a> and Tionne Watkins. Two years later he portrayed Silk in the film directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak – “Romeo Must Die” – with <a href=#>Jet Li</a>, <a href=#>Aaliyah</a>, and <a href=#>Anthony Anderson</a>, and “Exit Wounds”. DMX’s most recent role is in a 2013 movie “Blame It on the Hustle”.</p><p>In his less-than-private personal life, DMX was married to <a href=#>Tashera</a> from 1999 until 2010, however, he has fathered 15 children, so some of his financial problems can easily be identified – his application claiming bankruptcy in 2013 was disallowed, and in 2015 he was sentenced to six months jail for failure to pay child support. He has also faced numerous charges for traffic offences, alcohol-related offences, drugs, weapons…. the list is almost endless, but even periods in jail don’t seem to have had the desired effect on DMX! He is still alive, but almost died in a Yonkers hotel parking lot in 2016, from causes which are still unclear.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=40.057278481013><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>DMX</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>-$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>December 18, 1970</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Mount Vernon, New York, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 10 in (1.803 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>172 lbs</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Rapper, Record Producer</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Tashera Simmons (m. 1999–2014)</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Children</td><td>Xavier Simmons, Shawn Simmons, Praise Mary Ella Simmons, Tocoma Simmons, X Gon Give it to Ya, Party Up, Where The Hood At</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Parents</td><td>Joe Barker, Arnett Simmons, X Gon Give it to Ya, Party Up, Where The Hood At</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Siblings</td><td>Bonita Simmons, Shayla Simmons, X Gon Give it to Ya, Party Up, Where The Hood At</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Nicknames</td><td>DMX - The Great Depression , Earl Simmons , Darkman X , X , D , The Dog , Dark Man X , Dark Man Extreme</td></tr><tr readability=0.45714285714286><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/dmx</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.42424242424242><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/dmx</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.4><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/dmx/?hl=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.42424242424242><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.myspace.com/dmx</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0229422</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.allmusic.com/artist/dmx-mn0000661795</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Awards</td><td>American Music Award - Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Artist (2000, 2001)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Record Labels</td><td>Columbia Records, Ruffhouse, Bloodline Records, Ruff Ryders</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>Albums</td><td>And Then There Was X (1999), It’s Dark and Hell is Hot (1988), Year of the Dog… Again (2006), Year of the Dog...
