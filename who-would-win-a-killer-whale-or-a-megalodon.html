The battle could last hours or even days, but eventually, <b>the slow and deliberate attack of the smarter animal would win out</b>.</span></span> <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on a-z-animals.com</a><h2>Who would win a dolphin or a megalodon?</h2>A pod of several dozens could take on a megalodon, but they're not spinner dolphins (who form superpods thousands strong). Most bottlenose dolphin pods are just 10â€“20 individuals. However, as long as they're not caught out in the open, they can retreat to the shallows where megalodon can't reach. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>Which whale can defeat megalodon?</h2>Some larger estimates do exist (placing megalodon up to 67 feet in length and well beyond 50 tons), but the fact of the matter is megalodon was smaller than a blue whale. In terms of size, a blue whale gets the advantage. Blue whales are larger and heavier than a megalodon. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on a-z-animals.com</a><h2>Could anything beat a megalodon?</h2>A Livyatan would win a fight against a megalodon. The Livyatan has the size and speed advantage, bigger teeth, and it has endurance to last through a long fight. Another problem for the megalodon stems from the way that megalodons attack. They prefer to dig into the stomachs of their prey. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on a-z-animals.com</a><h2>Who will win megalodon or sperm whale?</h2>The whale's skin and blubber are thick, so the megalodon would have to keep going back for more to kill the whale. The sperm whale could counter, delivering a less effective bite of its own to the megalodon or trying to disorient it with its powerful echolocation. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on a-z-animals.com</a><h2>Megalodon Vs Orca Who Would Win?</h2><h2>What animal killed the megalodon?</h2>Megalodon may have been killed off by great white sharks, study suggests. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on independent.co.uk</a><h2>Is Leviathan bigger than megalodon?</h2>In fact, Megalodon might not even have been the largest predator in the ocean at the time it was alive - the recently discovered Leviathan whale (Livyatan melvillei) was potentially larger than Megalodon and occupied the same territorial waters. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on aquarium.co.za</a><h2>Would a megalodon beat at Rex?</h2>T-Rex would win the fight on land.

The team estimated it would have been large enough to comfortably hunt and consume prey animals up to eight meters in length, whole. That's roughly the size of modern killer whales, themselves apex predators. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on syfy.com</a><h2>Could a megalodon survive today?</h2>Despite this, there is no evidence that the megalodon still exists in the ocean today. The odds of a megalodon surviving until present day are extremely slim, and therefore it is most likely that this species has been extinct for millions of years. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>Who would win Mosasaurus or megalodon?</h2>While a similar length, the Megalodon had a much more robust body and huge jaws built for devouring whales and other large marine mammals. A Mosasaurus would not have been able to get its jaws around the much thicker body of the Megalodon. It would just take one catastrophic bite for the Megalodon to end the battle. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on fossilera.com</a><h2>What was bigger than megalodon?</h2>Ancient 57ft 62-ton 'livyatan' predator was bigger than Megalodon with teeth 'that could bite through most creatures' <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on the-sun.com</a><h2>Is there a megalodon skeleton?</h2>Fossilised megalodon vertebrae about the size of a dinner plate have also been found.

While previous estimates suggested that the megalodon could swim at 3.1mph, researchers now believe its top speed was more like 1.2mph. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on dailymail.co.uk</a><h2>Is Deep Blue still alive?</h2>While Deep Blue may be one of the largest fish in the ocean, these creatures can still be elusive and NOAA estimates a great white shark lifespan to be around 30-70 years so there's every chance Deep Blue is still alive and well in the ocean to this day. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on iflscience.com</a><h2>Could a megalodon eat the Titanic?</h2>However Titanic was 166 meters long and the hull was made from rolled steel from 2.5cm to 3.5cm thick.

However it would also do considerable injury to itself. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on worldbuilding.stackexchange.com</a><h2>Did NASA find a frozen megalodon?</h2>NASA has just discovered a frozen megalodon shark. in Antarctica. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on reptileknowledge.com</a><h2>Is megalodon older than T. rex?</h2>The megalodon and the T. rex did not live at the same time, so a battle between the two giants could have never happened.

Compare that to Tyrannosaurus rex, which had a bite force of 12,000 pounds per square inch, and it's clear you've got a mighty bite on your hands.
