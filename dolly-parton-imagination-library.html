And so, Daddy couldn’t read and write." Illiteracy was a source of embarrassment and frustration for Parton's father: He couldn't do things like complete forms, scan a newspaper or read to his children.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Parton witnessed how not being able to read or write impacted her intelligent father's entire life. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://parade.com/440805/dotsonrader/dolly-parton-on-coat-of-many-colors-faith-and-marriage/2/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="She also asked herself" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">She also asked herself</a>, "God, if he'd had an education, I wonder what all he might've been?" Thoughts of her father and his struggles were the spark that led to the Imagination Library, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nypl.org/blog/2018/05/30/what-are-you-reading-dolly-parton-interview data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="as Parton wanted to" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">as Parton wanted to</a> "do something that would inspire kids to love reading and to love learning. He never had anyone that inspired him in such a way."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1995, the program began in Sevier County, Tennessee, where Parton had been raised. As books arrived, parents read more to their children. This positive response led to expansion and more children receiving books. Parton's father was able to see the Library's success before he died in 2000, which was the same year the program went national. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.loc.gov/item/webcast-8329/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Parton said in 2018" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Parton said in 2018</a>, "It made me feel good in my heart that I could do something to make Daddy proud."</p><img alt="Dolly Parton and her Imagination Library donate their 100 millionth book to The Library of Congress on February 27, 2018, in Washington, DC." title="Dolly Parton and her Imagination Library donate their 100 millionth book to The Library of Congress on February 27, 2018, in Washington, DC." width=2000 height=1717 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dolly-parton-and-her-imagination-library-dontae-the-100-millionth-book-to-the-library-of-congress-on-february-27-2018-in-washington-dc-photo-by-shannon-finneygetty-images.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v2">Photo: Shannon Finney/Getty Images</span><p>Dolly Parton and her Imagination Library donated their 100 millionth book to The Library of Congress on February 27, 2018, in Washington, DC.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">She believes books are the gateway expanding children's imaginations</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though Parton didn't love school, she did enjoy reading as a child. Fairy tales <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://chapter16.org/the-book-lady-of-sevier-county/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="broadened her perspective" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">broadened her perspective</a>: "The only thing I ever saw growing up was poor people in overalls and brogan shoes and ragged clothes. But in my books, I would read about kings and queens with their velvet clothes and big diamond rings. That’s how I knew there was a world outside the Smoky Mountains."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Imagination Library aims to pick age-appropriate books that foster a "love of reading and learning; regard for diversity of people, their roles, culture and environment; promotion of self-esteem and confidence, appreciation of art and aesthetics." The first book distributed is one of Parton's favorites, The Little Engine That Could. A children's book by Parton herself, I Am a Rainbow, has also been included in the program.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Research has shown that exposure to reading at an early age leads to better results in school. And Parton knows that literacy has lifelong benefits. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/03/01/589912466/dolly-parton-gives-the-gift-of-literacy-a-library-of-100-million-books data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="As she told NPR in 2018" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">As she told NPR in 2018</a>, "If you can read, even if you can't afford education, you can go on and learn about anything you want to know. There's a book on everything."</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Parton loves being known as the 'Book Lady'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Parton and her husband don't have children, but that hasn't stopped her from being relatable to children. In fact, it's compelled her to devote as much time and energy as possible to causes like children's literacy. In 2018, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/country/dolly-parton-marriage-secrets-carl-thomas-dean/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she confided in People magazine" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">she confided in People magazine</a>, "Now that I'm older, I realize I didn’t have kids of my own, so everybody's kids could be mine."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Parton understands how to spark a child's excitement around books and reading. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://parade.com/440805/dotsonrader/dolly-parton-on-coat-of-many-colors-faith-and-marriage/2/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="She shared with Parade magazine" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">She shared with Parade magazine</a>, "From the time they're born, they get books in the mail with their little names on them. They love running to the mailbox!" And she opted to make the Imagination Library available to all children, no matter their family's financial status. "I have always felt we shouldn't leave anybody out or single anybody out," <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nashvillescene.com/arts-culture/article/13036295/dolly-parton-on-why-she-gives-free-books-to-hundreds-of-thousands-of-children data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she said in 2010" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">she said in 2010</a>. "Besides, it would probably cost more money to decide who needed it than it does just to give everyone a book."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hearing children refer to her as the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/country-music-legend-dolly-parton-s-new-roll-34-book-lady-34#transcript data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='"Book Lady"' class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">"Book Lady"</a> makes Parton happy. She also hasn't felt any need to adopt a more sedate persona for her young followers. Children accept her as she is, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dolly-parton-told-us-why-shes-the-perfect-babysitter_n_59e0de9de4b04d1d51815f90 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she's explained" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">she's explained</a>, "I'm like Mother Goose to them. I'm like a cartoon character. I'm over-exaggerated with my look and my voice is over-exaggerated and high-pitched like a kid and I’m joyful with kids and they feel that, too."</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">She believes it's her 'duty' to give back</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Parton journeyed from a childhood spent sharing a bed in a one-room cabin to life as a millionaire with hit records, movies and television projects, and she believes this success came with its own obligations. "I really think that once you're in a position to help, you definitely should help," <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rookiemag.com/2017/11/spread-love-interview-dolly-parton/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she declared in a 2017 interview" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">she declared in a 2017 interview</a>. "If God's been good to you, you should be good to other people. That's how we spread the love around. It makes me feel good to do it, and I think it’s my duty to do it."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Many charitable endeavors have received contributions from Parton, but working with the Imagination Library is particularly meaningful to her. During an interview with PBS, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/country-music-legend-dolly-parton-s-new-roll-34-book-lady-34#story data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she admitted" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">she admitted</a>, "The older I get, the more appreciative I seem to be of the 'Book Lady' title. It makes me feel more like a legitimate person, not just a singer or an entertainer. But it makes me feel like I have done something good with my life and with my success."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As the Imagination Library has grown by pairing with local partners, Parton has continued to offer her full support. All proceeds from her first children's album, I Believe in You (2017), went to the endeavor. And when she renewed wedding vows in 2016 with her notoriously private husband, Carl Dean, photos of the event were sold to support the Library.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">The singer aims to distribute one billion books</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/dolly-parton-charity-launches-free-book-programme-for-children-in-ireland-1.3793866 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Per Parton" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Per Parton</a>, "You can never get enough books into the hands of young children." It's a philosophy the Imagination Library lives by. Since its launch in 1995, it's grown to work with community partners in all fifty states and the District of Columbia, plus parts of Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Republic of Ireland. Braille and audiobooks began to be included in 2011. And there's interest in further expansion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While it took until 2003 for the Library to mail one million books, 15 years later, it had sent out 100 million. Parton donated a children's book she'd authored, Coat of Many Colors, to the Library of Congress as the nonprofit's 100th million book. The number of books distributed, which reached more than 125 million in September 2019, continues to climb. Parton has stated, "We're going for a billion, maybe, in my lifetime."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikrquZmLaiutJom6iknK56sa3RraanZZmirqi1zZqroqeeYrmqrtGaqbI%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdolly-parton-imagination-library.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdolly-parton-imagination-library.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdolly-parton-imagination-library.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdolly-parton-imagination-library.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdolly-parton-imagination-library.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdolly-parton-imagination-library.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bobby-misner-dad-net-worth-bio-wiki-age-clothing-dad-net-worth-and-clothing-line-3.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bobby-misner-dad-net-worth-bio-wiki-age-clothing-dad-net-worth-and-clothing-line-3.html>Bobby Misner Dad, Net Worth, Bio, Wiki, Age, Clothing, Dad Net worth and Clothing Line</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./samira-nasr-bio-age-ethnicity-parents-husband-son-harpers-bazaar.html>Samira Nasr Bio, Age, Ethnicity, Parents, Husband, Son, Harpers Bazaar</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./samira-nasr-bio-age-ethnicity-parents-husband-son-harpers-bazaar.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
