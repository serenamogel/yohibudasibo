Additionally, their strong social skills allow them to make a good initial first impression. They can show great interest in romantic prospects and seduce with generosity, expressions of love, flattery, sex, romance, and promises of commitment.<h2>Do narcissists break promises?</h2>If persuasion, guilt, and attention-getting behaviors don't pull you back into the relationship, the narcissist pulls out the promise to change.
