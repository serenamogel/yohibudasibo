It’s gotten to the point where you can’t even mercilessly body shame someone on the internet until they change schools anymore, not without some white knight coming to their rescue and being all “Hey, stop acting like a monster. That’s a human being.”</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=518 data-current-count=518 data-injectable=true>But do you know who’s not a human being? An <strong>alien</strong>. You can say just about anything you want about a fictional alien’s looks and no one can sue you for emotional damages. It’s like a life hack for the social contract, and it’s made all the sweeter by the opportunity to call E.T. a pear-shaped little nobody in a public forum. He thinks he’s better than me just because he made a phone out of a kid’s Speak & Spell? You know what’s really cool, E.T.? Owning your own phone. You’re an adult. Grow up.</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=134 data-injectable=false>And so, like the mean girls we’ve always been deep inside, let’s Burn Book some <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">little green men</a> with bad skin and no girlfriends.</p><h2 id=h-10-droopy-mccool data-injectable=false>10: Droopy McCool</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Droopy-McCool.png><p data-characters=689 data-current-count=689 data-injectable=true>Imagine if the Jim Henson company built a tardigrade Muppet on a day when everyone was hungover. That’s Droopy McCool, the space-oboe player for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Max Rebo Band</a> in Return of the Jedi. In truth, he’d be higher up on the list if it weren’t for two extenuating circumstances: The fact that he kind of looks like someone drew the bottom half of a dog’s face and then never finished it, and the world that he was born into. Star Wars has a longstanding tradition of forcing background aliens to play woodwind instruments like a bunch of nerds. It’s not your fault you had to join the marching band right when you were at your most awkward, Droopy. Still, would some pomade kill you?</p><p data-characters=99 data-current-count=99 data-injectable=false>Final judgment: Coruscant 2, Mos Eisley 6. Stop soaking your reeds in the break room, it’s gross.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>9: Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ax.png><p data-characters=130 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>Let’s start with the obvious stuff: His brother was a prince, so if this guy just screams “entitlement,” there’s a reason.</p><p data-characters=494 data-current-count=494 data-injectable=true>Aximili-Esgarrouth-Isthill was the Andalite buddy to a bunch of child soldiers in the Animorphs books and TV series. Sure, his look was gaudy – Horse body plus scorpion tail plus guy chest plus Andorian head? Hat on a hat much? – but the really unattractive parts of him were more than skin deep. Making friends with a bunch of seventh graders and then encouraging them to believe that your nickname is “Ax” shows a level of internal ugliness not usually seen outside of youth ministry.</p><p data-characters=129 data-current-count=129 data-injectable=false>Final judgment: Morph into someone with self-esteem, “Ax.” PS, we talked to your mom and we know that your real name is Paul.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>8: Abzorbaloff</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Abzorbo.jpg><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=190 data-injectable=false>“Now there’s a mucus-colored troll doll with the lady who played Moaning Myrtle in his solar plexus,” you might say. “Better swipe right quick before someone else snatches him up.”</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>And do you know what’s worse? He’s a catfisher. The guy presents as a looker named Victor with a 10/10 coif and van dyke and then drops a shirtless, mohawk-that-incorporates-his-back-hair look on you after a couple of months. Not cool. Even for a one-off <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">episode of Doctor Who</a>, not cool.</p><p data-characters=109 data-current-count=109 data-injectable=false>Final judgment: Congrats on beating steep odds and being the pastiest, doughiest guy on the BBC, Abzorbaloff.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>7: Grand Nagus Zek</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Grand-Nagus.png><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>Let’s go down the list: Ears are too big to look good on a human and too small to look good on a Ferengi. Lots of body hair issues, doesn’t file his teeth enough – grooming seems like a consistent problem. Gaudy taste in clothes. Works too much and always talks about it. Not much of a listener. Career politician. He’d be ranked lower, but he’s rich.</p><p data-characters=84 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>Final judgment: It’s not definitely going to happen, but it’s not inconceivable.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>6: This little guy from V: The Final Battle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/V-baby.png><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=643 data-injectable=true>In recent days, Hollywood has been giving baby aliens the kinderschema treatment, inflating their eyeballs and scaling down their mouths until the audience’s ovaries get sore. It’s the tactic that put a Grogu under every tree for the last three Christmases and a Baby Groot on every pack of pistachios for the last four Pistach Wednesdays.</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>V, on the other hand, was of a different age – an age when you could stick a priest and Freddy Krueger in a room while a woman gave birth, film the wet Boglin that came out of her, and call it a cult classic. And that’s where this little miracle of life came from. Just look at it. It’s like it the Hulk stuck out his tongue and it was just a smaller, veinier Hulk.</p><p data-characters=65 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>Final judgment: The “V” stands for “vunattractive.” Next.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>5: This guy&nbsp;that Scotty is holding</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Star-Trek-dog.png><p data-characters=129 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true>First seen on Star Trek episode “The Enemy Within,” he’s not outwardly ugly, but the stuff he says on Twitter is repugnant.</p><p data-characters=112 data-current-count=112 data-injectable=false>Final judgment: You don’t get to call it “satire” just because people on the internet get mad at you, guy.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>4: The thing from The Thing</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/The-Thing.png><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>Another in a long line of on-screen aliens who can look however they want to look, but somehow wind up as a mess of tentacles and liquid latex, snot, and Karo syrup. Messy eater. Mean to dogs. Also, if he gets too close to a candle or tries to light your cigarette for you, he’ll turn into a punctured can of Silly String made out of wet ham.</p><p data-characters=26 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>Final judgment: Hard pass.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>3: Wioslea</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Star-Wars-Vuvrian.png><p data-characters=483 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true>What’s that? You don’t remember Wioslea? That’s because she got cut from the first Star Wars movie. Yeah, a movie that proudly featured a jam band made of butts with bug eyes started second guessing its aesthetic when Wioslea hit the screen. It’s like she told the mover that was carrying her eyes into her new face to just put them wherever and then she never rearranged. My home office still looks like her face, but with my vinyl collection instead of a thousand eyeballs.</p><p data-characters=544 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>For the record, this was the lady that bought Luke’s speeder when he “noped” out of the family business like, ten seconds after the Empire showed his aunt and uncle 11 herbs and spices up close. It’s probably for the best that our heroes got off-planet before Wioslea she got behind the wheel. She’s got “distracted driver” written all over her. Pedestrians in Mos Espa probably started dropping like flies the week she got a car. In short, we can’t wait for her Disney Plus series, we hear it’s the new Andor.</p><p data-characters=104 data-current-count=104 data-injectable=false>Final judgment: There are a couple of ways to interpret the words “weird looking,” and she’s both.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>2: E.T.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ET.png><p data-characters=201 data-current-count=201 data-injectable=false>Pear-shaped little nobody. You thought I was kidding earlier, but I said what I said.&nbsp;By all means, argue this point all you want; heck — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">another writer on this very site did</a>, but I stand by it.</p><p data-characters=91 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>Final judgment: Don’t eat food off the ground, and stop hanging out with kids, you creep.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>1: Yoz and Tak</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Farscape-Yoz.png><p data-characters=227 data-current-count=227 data-injectable=false>Farscape was a heck of a thing. It was weird. Its aliens were weirder. They were designed by a bunch of guys who spent the rest of their time making backup Elmos for PBS. There was going to be some creative frustration to vent.</p><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=692 data-injectable=true>But then came Yoz and Tak, a couple of Halosians from season two, hanging out in space, puking up Jell-O shots and generally being little stinkers. Their ugliness doesn’t come down to their evil plan – chasing an alien promotion by killing a show’s protagonists is pretty boilerplate stuff in sci-fi. It doesn’t even come down to the fact that they look kind of like birds, creatures which are a mistake of evolution and deserve whatever’s coming to them.</p><p data-characters=624 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true>No, the Halosians are ugly for one reason above all others: That they’re definitely just the Skeksis from The Dark Crystal, right? Some puppet designer at the Henson workshop rolled into work at the Farscape office late one day, panicked when he realized he had an assignment due, and dusted off an old Skeksis that someone left in a storage tub next to his desk. “Here you go, guys,” he said, “A brand new, never-before-seen creature of my own design,” and because it was the early-2000s and caffeinated malt liquors were just starting to take off, nobody noticed what was happening until the show made it to DVD.</p><p data-characters=92 data-current-count=92 data-injectable=false>Final judgment: The ugliest thing anyone can do is not be themselves. Also, birds are gross.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXWZ9bsHGpaCeq6Rirq21xKeqZp6ipLpuuc6voJ6rXZa7pXnTnqOerpmotrC6jg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-10-ugliest-aliens-from-movies-and-television.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-10-ugliest-aliens-from-movies-and-television.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-10-ugliest-aliens-from-movies-and-television.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-10-ugliest-aliens-from-movies-and-television.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-10-ugliest-aliens-from-movies-and-television.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-10-ugliest-aliens-from-movies-and-television.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./remnant-2.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./remnant-2.html>Does Remnant 2 Have Crossplay?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./darnell-hines-obituary-los-angeles-ca-darnell-hines-has-sadly-passed-away-gofundme.html>Darnell Hines Obituary, Los Angeles CA, Darnell Hines Has Sadly Passed Away, GoFundMe</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./darnell-hines-obituary-los-angeles-ca-darnell-hines-has-sadly-passed-away-gofundme.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
