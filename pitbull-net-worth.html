The house, which is located in the upscale Pinecrest neighborhood of Port Saint Lucie, FL, is in significant disarray.</p><p>Neighbors have had enough and are requesting that the recording artist clean up his abandoned home. It’s not only unsightly, but no one wants to live next to a shambles.</p><p>However, a little digging revealed that the house isn’t actually owned by Pitbull. It isn’t even owned by Armando Christian Pérez, as his birth certificate indicates.</p><p>“ENPI GAO, LLC is the owner of the property. Candice J. Hart, senior associate attorney at Business Law Group, P.A., claims it was purchased for $850,000 in February 2015.</p><h2>Pitbull | Lifestyle</h2><p>As of December 2023 Pitbull’s net worth is staggering $100 million.</p><p>This American rapper keeps his personal life incredibly quiet. He won’t say where he lives or how he spends his money since he believes it is none of anybody else’s concern but his own.</p><p>You can be sure, though, that he is spending the majority of his hard-earned money on his lovely children, wife, and home to keep them happy and well-cared.</p><p>He has also remarked in interviews and albums that “money is a key issue in life,” but this does not imply that he is experiencing financial difficulties.</p><p><strong>Read About <a href=# rel=noopener>25 Richest Female Rappers in the World</a></strong></p><h2>Pitbull | Music & Endorsement, Albums, Singles, Concerts, YouTube, Other Venture</h2><h3>Music & Endorsement</h3><p>Pitbull has made more than $7 million in album sales and $60 million in concert revenue. His YouTube earning totals $41 million, with another $3 million coming from his acting career.</p><p>He’s also a really excellent businessman, having made over $7 million through enterprises such as a Vodka line, a restaurant chain, and a radio station.</p><p>He has had endorsement deals with a variety of brands, including Kodak, Walmart, and Pepsi. He’s appeared in video games, films, and television series.</p><p>Throughout it all, he’s made an average of $10 million per year, with his earnings reaching as high as $20 million by 2016.</p><h3>Albums</h3><p>Pitbull’s net worth is $100 million, and his albums add only $3 million to it. That’s only approximately 4% of the total.</p><p>Why is it so small? People simply do not purchase records any longer.</p><p>Before we start weeping for the performers, keep in mind that the same technology that killed the DVD is now bringing in new revenue streams via internet streaming.</p><p>A musician who can get a lot of eyes (and ears) on his or her YouTube channel can make a lot of money.</p><p>Pitbull’s share of overall revenue is calculated at 8.85 percent because he writes some of his own music. To put it another way, his 2004 album M.I.A.M.I. sold 570,000 copies at an average price of $10.99 apiece.</p><p>Pitbull kept an estimated $554,391 from the total income of $6.2 million.</p><h3>Singles</h3><p>Pitbull released 46 singles between 2008 and 2014. Kanye West was tethered by this. Despite the fact that Pitbull’s sales are nothing near those of Kanye, he has nine RIAA-certified singles.</p><p>The smallest of these was Krazy, which sold 570,000 units in 2008. Timber, a 6x Platinum song with approximately seven million views worldwide, was the most popular in 2013.</p><h3>Concerts</h3><p>How much of Pitbull’s net worth comes from his concerts? Before taxes and expenditures, it’s anticipated to be $60.3 million. Pitbull has toured the world six times since 2009.</p><p>It’s worth noting that the superstar didn’t go on his first major concert tour until he was five years into his career.</p><p>The Rebelution Tour, which took place from 2009 to 2011, was that tour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pitbull-Performing-on-pay-per-view-concert.jpg><p>The concert grossed roughly $16.5 million at $50 per ticket, with 51 shows at venues averaging 6,500 seats apiece.</p><p>Pitbull is thought to have pocketed almost 80% of the money, or $13.2 million.</p><p>Pitbull was paid less in some of the gigs. For example, due to sharing the stage with superstar Kesha, he only received an estimated 40% of the proceeds from the 2013 North American Tour.</p><p>His 2014 tour with Enrique Iglesias netted him an even lesser 15%. His 2015/16 Pitbull: Time of Our Lives tour was his highest-earning tour.</p><p>The tour lasted 93 gigs and grossed an estimated $23 million, with Pitbull pocketing $18.6 million.</p><h3>YouTube</h3><p>Before taxes and costs, YouTube contributes $41 million to Pitbull’s net worth. The rapper does not make a lot of money through albums and single sales, but he makes a lot of money from the digital platform.</p><p>Pitbull’s Vevo channel has a massive following, with over six billion views.</p><h3>Other Venture</h3><p>Pitbull sponsors a variety of brands outside of music, including Bud Light, Kodak, and Dr. Pepper. He debuted his own scent brand in November 2013. In 2015, he was also involved in Walmart’s marketing campaigns.</p><p>Pitbull is the spokesman and controlling owner of Voli Vodka. Similarly, Globalization Radio, a new Sirius radio channel Pitbull created, debuted in May 2015.</p><p>He appeared in a Super Bowl commercial featuring Jennifer Lopez, DJ Khaled, and Steven Van Zandt, among others.</p><p>Pitbull earned $35 million through tours, endorsements, royalties, and other sources in a single year. That was enough to make him one of the world’s top ten highest-paid rappers.</p><p>Pitbull earned $18 million between September 2018 and September 2019.</p><h2>Pitbull | Career</h2><p>Pitbull’s musical career began in 2002 when Lil Jon introduced him to rapping. Pitbull’s debut solo album, TVT Records, was released in 2004.</p><p>Pitbull released his third album, ‘The Boatlift,’ in 2007. Trina, Lil Jon, and Kesha are some of the top artists in the industry with whom he has collaborated.</p><p>He released his fourth album in 2009. ‘I Know You Want Me,’ ‘Hotel Room Service,’ and ‘Blanco’ are among the album’s most well-known tracks.</p><p>His gigs, which included the ‘Planet Pit World Tour,’ ‘Rebelution Tour,’ ‘North American Tour,’ and ‘Pitbull Live in Hong-Kong,’ drew massive crowds because of his continual grooving and pop music.</p><h2>Pitbull | Charity</h2><p>Pitbull has been involved in a number of charitable organizations.</p><p>During Hurricane Maria, he used his own private plane to help people who required medical assistance from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States.</p><p>Similarly, Pitbull is dedicated to assisting the Latino population in Little Havana, Miami.</p><p>He founded Sports Leadership and Management, a free public charter school.
