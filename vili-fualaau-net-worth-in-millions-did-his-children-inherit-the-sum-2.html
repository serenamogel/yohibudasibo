The child was no other than the 13-year-old Vili Fualaau.</p><p>In 1996, Vili Fualaau, a student in the sixth grade, was just 13 years old when sixth-grade teacher Mary Kay Letourneau started having intercourse with him. However, it was simply their love tale for Letourneau and Fualaau.</p><h2 id=vili-fualaau-net-worth-in-millions-did-his-children-inherit-the-sum><span class=ez-toc-section id=vili-fualaau-net-worth-in-millions-%e2%80%93-did-his-children-inherit-the-sum></span> Vili Fualaau Net Worth In Millions – Did His Children Inherit The Sum? <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>According to High-Income Source, Vili Fualaau net worth is estimated at around $2 million as of 2022. Born on June 26, 1983, in Burian, Washington, in the United States, the 39-year-old has two children</p><p>To many who wonder how he has such a vast amount of money, his marijuana company is where he makes the majority of his money. Vili Fualaau is well-known for having a sexual connection with Mary Kay Letourneau, his sixth-grade teacher, which caused controversy across the country.&nbsp;</p><p>After the passing of Mary Kay on July 6, 2020, at 58 due to colorectal cancer, Fualaau, who divorced her in 2019, lives with his two daughters. Speaking with The Dr. Oz Show, he said he would “seek some help” if he were tempted to become a minor.&nbsp;</p><p>Fualaau is now roughly the same age as Mary was when she first started abusing him, and Dr. Oz wonders what he would do if he started to feel attracted to a youngster. “I’d probably go and seek some help.”</p><p>The couple divorced in August 2019, and Despite their split, Fualaau remained at Letourneau’s side when she passed away, and she bequeathed a sizable portion of her assets to him.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=vili-fualaau-and-mary-kay-letourneau-daughters-and-family-facts><span class=ez-toc-section id=vili-fualaau-and-mary-kay-letourneau-daughters-and-family-facts></span> Vili Fualaau And Mary Kay Letourneau Daughters And Family Facts<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>When Mary first started assaulting Fualaau sexually, she was a sixth-grade teacher. She was eventually given a jail term of more than seven years. Before Fualaau turned 15, she conceived his daughters on two separate occasions in defiance of court orders to keep them apart.</p><p>Even though their union was against the law, the pair gave birth to two children, one in 1997 and the other in 1998, while Fualaau was still a young adolescent.</p><p>Letourneau was sentenced to two terms in jail, the first for three months and the second for seven years, as restitution. She was not allowed to visit Fualaau when she was freed in 2004, although he had turned 21 and got the ban lifted.</p><p>In 2005, they got hitched. However, Fualaau and Letourneau parted ways in 2017 due to Fualaau’s formal separation request, and the divorce was finalized in August 2019, a year before her demise.</p><p>Letourneau and Fualaau continued to live together while their relationship broke down, and they could still be seen out and about in the Seattle region on occasion. Their two children, Georgia and Audrey, continued to be involved in their life.</p><p>Find Out: Who Is Geneen Roth?
