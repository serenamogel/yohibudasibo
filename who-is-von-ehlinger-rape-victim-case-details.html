His consistent claim is that he is not guilty of this crime.</p><p>This accusation resulted in Von Ehlinger receiving sole blame from a 12-person jury in March 2021. Fourth District Judge Michael Reardon sentenced him to serve at least eight years until parole eligibility comes around in 2030. It was announced that he would serve at least twenty years behind bars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/01xp-sentencing-01-articleLarge.png><p>Von Ehlinger blames court malfeasance during trial proceedings for leading to erroneous judgment offenses; one example was discussed regarding wrongful permitting practitioners involved with conducting sexual assault examinations on said apprentice above towards making statements about their experiences around such time, which further cast accusations onto Von Ehlinger downplaying his version of events repeatedly stated under oath.</p><p>Despite all this, the Idaho Supreme Court intends to assess his legal team’s arguments as they review the case in an appeals process.</p><p>This decision would be significant and could either uphold, modify or overturn Von Ehlinger’s sentence and conviction.</p><p>Read more: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Cynthia Defelice Missing Case – Where Was She Last Seen?
