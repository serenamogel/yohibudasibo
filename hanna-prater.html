There will be a constant focus upon your personal life, and maintaining secrecy can be dull. But today we will talk about a power couple who are famous for their longterm relationship. Miss <strong>Hanna Prater</strong> is among the list of super hot celebrity wife who got married to Formula One racing driver, <strong>Sebastian Vettel</strong>.</p><p>Prater's boyfriend-turned husband, Sebastian, is a four-time Formula One World Champion who is regarded as one of the greatest drivers in the history of the sport. On the contrast, Prater is working on her line of fashion clothing and accessories.</p><h2>Hanna Prater and Sebastian Vettel married in 2019</h2><p>The former design student married her school sweetheart and the father of her two daughters in a small ceremony.

When asked why she doesn't attend Vettel's races, she stated that the racing arena is simply a place of work for him, and she has no desire to go there and distract him.</p><h2>Gave birth to two children before marriage</h2><p>The four-time world champion and his old-time girlfriend welcomed two children before their wedding. They welcomed their first child, a daughter named <strong>Emily Vettel, </strong>on <i>January 12, 2014</i>.

They started living together in 2010 and purchased a home in Switzerland.</p><p>The husband-wife duo is also expecting a third child which was revealed at the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2019.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>As a designer and the founder of her own fashion line, Hanna Prater might have amassed a net worth of <strong>$300,000</strong>.
