I merely wanted to know whether he was alive or not. It hurts the way he passed away. It is beyond description.’</strong></p><p>According to the boy’s mother, who spoke to the AP, <strong>‘her son started a new job two weeks earlier but never got his first salary and that she was unable to call the friend as she only knew a first name; Jeffrey.’</strong></p><p>Jeffrey was given 15 consecutive life terms in 1992 for the murders of Tony and 14 other individuals when he eventually acknowledged killing Tony, according to History.</p><p>Jeffrey killed a total of 17 men and teenagers between 1978 and 1991.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Sixth Episode Of Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story Reveals The Truth Of Tony Hughes’s Death</h2><p>It’s not entirely clear how much of the episode is based on reality and how much has been fabricated, but the show describes how the two first got attracted to one another and even has Jeffrey visiting some of Hughes’ picture sessions.</p><p>The episode in the series has very few details about Tony’s murder by Jeffrey Dahmer.&nbsp;</p><p>The Associated Press reported that Jeffrey Dahmer scooped up his deaf victim, took him inside, lulled him to sleep, and then dissected him while retaining the skull.</p><p>According to FBI records, Hughes, 31, had not been seen since acquaintances last saw him at the 219-Club on May 24.
