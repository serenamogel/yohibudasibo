She was born on November 23, 1960, and comes from a family that spent her early years in Mississippi before moving on to Southeastern Louisiana University to complete her studies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/What-does-Robin-Roberts-Partner-do-for-a-living-min-1024x580.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_the_partner_of_Robin_Robert></span><strong>Who is the partner of Robin Robert?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Amber Laign, a massage therapist, has been Robin Roberts’ companion since 2005. The two enjoy a strong and enduring relationship. A chance blind date set up by their shared acquaintances marked the beginning of their love affair. Despite Robin’s well-known work, Amber values her privacy and likes to maintain a low profile. They have exhibited amazing unity and support for one another throughout their relationship, even during the most trying times.</p><p>This includes supporting one another while Robin was battling illness and Amber was battling breast cancer. Their relationship is strong and resilient, inspiring many people in the process. Their continued dedication to one another is proof of the strength of love and support in overcoming challenges in life. Through their journey, Robin and Amber have demonstrated the value of sticking together and facing obstacles together.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Relationship_between_Robin_Robert_and_Amber_Laign></span><strong>Relationship between Robin Robert and Amber Laign</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Robin Roberts has been dating Amber Laign for a very long time. In 2005, the two went on a blind date and have been dating ever since. In contrast to Roberts’ public-facing work, Laign is a massage therapist and businesswoman who has decided to maintain a private life away from the spotlight. Laign has been Roberts’ unwavering supporter through pivotal life events, including Roberts’ health issues and Laign’s own battle with breast cancer, despite the fact that she prefers seclusion.</p><p>Laign has proven to be strong and resilient throughout her experience. She has been essential in taking care of Roberts during her health issues, and she has also battled breast cancer herself. As she navigates her own journey and continues to support Roberts in theirs, her tenacity and optimistic perspective have inspired many.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Over_the_years_Amber_Laign_has_held_a_number_of_professions_and_co-founded_a_company></span><strong>Over the years, Amber Laign has held a number of professions and co-founded a company.</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Amber Laign is more than simply someone who dates one of the most well-known morning television news anchors. Although Robin Roberts’ partner may not have a career as well-known as her counterpart’s, we still think her job is fairly cool.</p><p>Laign made a living as a massage therapist for almost 10 years, according to her LinkedIn profile; during that time, she performed everything from Swedish massages to deep tissue massages. It appears that she ended her massage therapy career in 2020. Laign spent nine years as a sales representative for Berger and Stevens before she entered the massage industry. Manta observed that the shop carried women’s apparel, but it has now shut its doors.</p><p>There’s more, and Laign has occupations other than those of a massage therapist and a sales representative. Laign co-founded Plant Juice Oils in 2017 with Marci Freede, in accordance with her profile. According to their website, the two women met in a dog park in the big apple and became friends over their shared love of oils.</p><p>The website also pays tribute to Roberts, whose health journey—likely while she was battling cancer—helped Laign become motivated to launch the wellness company. The majority of the items on the store, which include oils, bath bombs, and even gel caps, include CBD. The items are designed to help with a variety of issues, such as stress, sleep, pain, and brain fog.</p><p class=has-medium-font-size><strong>Also, Read</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmignpe0tnrNnqtor5iWwW6wzp6qZqqfl7avedGomZ6qpKh6sa3RraWeql2ZvG6yzqtkmmWcnsOqusZo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-does-robin-roberts-partner-do-for-a-living.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-does-robin-roberts-partner-do-for-a-living.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-does-robin-roberts-partner-do-for-a-living.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-does-robin-roberts-partner-do-for-a-living.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-does-robin-roberts-partner-do-for-a-living.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-does-robin-roberts-partner-do-for-a-living.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./christopher-benstead.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./christopher-benstead.html>Christopher Benstead movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kevin-frazier-and-nischelle-turner-to-host-2023-palm-springs-international-film-awards.html>Kevin Frazier and Nischelle Turner Become First Black Hosts of the 2023 Palm Springs International F</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kevin-frazier-and-nischelle-turner-to-host-2023-palm-springs-international-film-awards.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
