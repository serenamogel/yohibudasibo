He is the son of performers Nancy Morgan and John Ritter. After completing his education, he made his acting debut in the 1990s made-for-television biopic “The Dreamer of Oz: The L Frank Baum Story.”</p><p>But it was his portrayal as Kevin Girardi in the TV series “Joan of Arcadia” that made him famous. His interpretation of the character and the perspective he offered it were both praised by the crowd as well as the titans of the business.</p><p>A slew of possibilities came his way in the aftermath. Ritter improved his craft throughout his career, whether he was portraying Ethan Haas in “The Class,” Sean Walker in the NBC drama “The Event,” or even Dipper Pines in “Gravity Falls.”</p><p>He was even nominated for an Emmy for his performance as Mark Cyr in the NBC television series “Parenthood.” Another Period and Kevin (Probably) Saves the World are among his recent and future titles.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jason Ritter’s Nationality</h2><p>Jason Ritter is American by nationality</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jason Ritter’s Net Worth</h2><p>Jason Ritter’s net worth is estimated to be $6 million</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How old is Jason Ritter?</h2><p>Jason Ritter was born on February 17, 1980, which makes him 42 years old</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jason Ritter’s Height & Weight</h2><p>His height is 1.70 meters tall and his weight is currently unknown</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What does Jason Ritter do for a living?</h2><p>Jason Ritter is an actor</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jason Ritter’s Education</h2><p>Jason Ritter attended the New York University</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jason Ritter’s Career</h2><p>Ritter made his debut on television for his father’s program, “Three’s Company.” He had just turned one at the time. From Seasons 6 through 8, he could be seen in the opening credits standing next to “Janet Wood” as she petted a goat.</p><p>Ritter made her major cinematic debut in 1990 with the made-for-television biographical movie “The Dreamer of Oz: The L. Frank Baum Story.” However, Ritter vanished from the screen after “The Dreamer of Oz” until making a triumphant comeback in 1999 with a starring part in the third season of the television show “Undressed.”</p><p>Ritter was in a minor part in the hit drama “Days of Our Lives” in 1999. In the movie “Mumford,” he even made his cinematic debut as Martin Brockett.</p><p>Ritter has two films scheduled for release in 2002: “PG” and “Swimfan.” He also had a cameo appearance in “Hack” as Teddy Griffin. Ritter starred in the horror movie “Freddy vs. Jason” the year after.</p><p>Before ultimately landing the main part in the television series “Joan of Arcadia,” he also made a few guest appearances. Ritter’s future as an actor was altered as a result.</p><p>Even though Ritter has a long number of movies and TV shows to his credit, “Joan of Arcadia” stands out as the most promising and identifiable of all of them.</p><p>Ritter’s first big break as a main actor came from the fantasy TV show. It was really admirable and interesting how Kevin Girardi, a paraplegic boy, began his career by working for the local newspaper before finally becoming a local news anchor.</p><p>It also paved the road for Ritter to work on some fantastic projects and portray characters in both cinema and television, with his Emmy Award-nominated performance in “Parenthood” standing out as the finest of them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqacpZmenrJuuNinqqSdqah6tLzOrqqeZZ2asrV5yZqqqKZdp7a1wMSrZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmelanie-lynskeys-spouse-meet-jason-ritter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmelanie-lynskeys-spouse-meet-jason-ritter.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmelanie-lynskeys-spouse-meet-jason-ritter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmelanie-lynskeys-spouse-meet-jason-ritter.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmelanie-lynskeys-spouse-meet-jason-ritter.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmelanie-lynskeys-spouse-meet-jason-ritter.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./samira-nasr-bio-age-ethnicity-parents-husband-son-harpers-bazaar.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./samira-nasr-bio-age-ethnicity-parents-husband-son-harpers-bazaar.html>Samira Nasr Bio, Age, Ethnicity, Parents, Husband, Son, Harpers Bazaar</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./marwan-kenzari.html>Who Is Film Wolf Actor Marwan Kenzari Girlfriend?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./marwan-kenzari.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
